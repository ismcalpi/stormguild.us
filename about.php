				<p class="lead">Storm was established with the idea that life comes before raiding. We wanted to create a competitive raiding guild with a focus on progression in a much reduced schedule than other current Mythic guilds out there. The idea was to create an age 21+ environment/community for those of us with other obligations in life such as school, work, and family. If a lot of time isn't something you have, but you enjoy the hardcore aspects of what end game content provides, then we're the place for you.</p>

				</div>
				<p class="lead">Respect towards EVERYONE. This includes fellow guild members, peers on the server, developers, and guild competition. While any publicity is good publicity, we don't need any bad publicity. A drama free environment is essential both internally and externally.</p>
				<p class="lead">We are a progression raiding guild above anything else. We are all adults here, and while constructive criticism is welcomed, we do not tolerate any assholes. This means we expect all players to learn from their mistakes as well as others. While mistakes are expected to be made, we will point them out. Understand that this is essential in learning an encounter. Please do not take it personally, we do this so the whole raid can learn from a mistake, not to belittle one person.</p>
				<p class="lead">With the above being said, we want to create a relaxed raiding environment. We should be having fun killing pixels and conversing with other members. Camaraderie is a powerful thing and should never be over-looked.</p>

				<div class="u-heading-v2-3--bottom g-brd-blue g-mb-30">
					<h2 class="h3 text-uppercase g-font-weight-300 u-heading-v2__title">Raiding Information</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="lead"><strong class="g-color-blue">Raid Times</strong> We raid 8:00-11:30PM EST Wednesday and Thursday. Invites are sent out 15-30 minutes prior to the raid start time. We will pull at 8:00 sharp, it's best you're prepared and ready to go at the raid entrance.
				<br/><i>**We raid an extra day with extended hours and breaks the first week of new Mythic Content. (2:00-11:00PM EST). Be aware that you may have to adjust your work schedule accordingly.</i></p>
				<p class="lead"><strong class="g-color-blue">Roster</strong> We will carry a Mythic roster of about 25 players. While we don't recruit for a bench, if that is something you are interested in, please lets us know in your application.</p>
				<p class="lead"><strong class="g-color-blue">Raid Composition</strong> Best 20 players, followed by the best class comp will be utilized for raid progression. That means it's quite possible some people will need to sit because their class is just not as effective as another for certain encounters. The needs of the guild come before personal needs. Don't take it personal. (We'll bring as many people we have up to the max of 30 if we are doing normal/heroic for any reason).</p>
				<p class="lead"><strong class="g-color-blue">Loot Distribution</strong> All loot is handled via loot council using RCLootCouncil. Loot will be distributed based off many factors such as attendance, seniority, tier bonuses, upgrade level, and previous loot received. Trials are last on the list for loot, don't take it personal. We feel that Loot Council is the best system for improving the guild as a whole because loot can be delegated to where it is needed most.  If you have any questions on a loot decision, talk it up with an officer outside of raids.</p>

				<div class="u-heading-v2-3--bottom g-brd-blue g-mb-30">
					<h2 class="h2 text-uppercase g-font-weight-300 u-heading-v2__title">Attendance</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="lead">Near perfect attendance is required of all our raiders. We raid two nights a week, there is no time for any kind of non-sense. Attendance will be taken 15 minutes prior to the official start time of raid, as well as in 25 minute increments afterwards. If you cannot make a raid, you are required to make a post on the forums, or let the leadership know that you will be absent. If you no-post-no-show you are disrespecting every other raider in the guild. Doing so multiple times is a quick ticket out of the guild. Emergencies do happen and everyone understands that, sometimes you simply cannot get to your computer/phone and will not be there. Don't abuse this understanding.</p>
				<p class="lead"><strong class="g-color-blue">Elaboration on attendance</strong> Because we split our attendance into 25 minute increments, your attendance for one night is split amongst 10 checkpoints. Each checkpoint is worth 10% of your attendance for the given night. You receive 10% for being on time and 10% for being present at the end of raid. For example,  if you show up late at 8:15 and are present for the remainder of the raid, your attendance for the night would be 80%.</p>
